## Responsive image slider(using only HTML, CSS, and Javascript)

- There are two buttons to navigate between images
(forward and backward).
- The images have automatically transition every 3 seconds.
- Transition Effects: Included smooth transition effects
when switching between images to enhance the slider's
appearance.
- When the user hovers over the slider, the automatic
transition pauses.
- Pagination Indicators: Added dots below the slider to
indicate the currently active image, which can also be used
to navigate between images.
- Swipe Functionality: Made the slider swipeable on
touch screens to allow users to navigate between images
by swiping.
